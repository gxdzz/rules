# Server Rules
In order to maintain a healthy community, please abide by the following rules at all times. This list of rules by no means exhaustive. If unsure about whether something falls within the rules, please consult a staff member beforehand—we’ll be happy to help you out.
## General Rules
1. Follow the [Discord Terms of Services](https://discord.com/tos) and the [Discord Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines).
2. Follow the [GodzBot Code of Conduct](https://github.com/gxdzz/code-of-conduct).
3. Follow and respect staff members and their instructions.
4. This is an English and Spanish-only server, so please speak English and Spanish to the best of your ability.
5. No spamming or unapproved advertising of unrelated content, including other Discord bots, servers, and social media pages.
6. Keep discussions relevant to channel topics and guidelines.
## Nickname Policy
1. No invisible mames.
2. No advertising in nicknames.
3. No noisy unicode characters, such as ẓ̷̄ǎ̷̮̞l̶̰̞̓ģ̶̮̊́o̷̟̒ and 𝓯𝓪𝓷𝓬𝔂 𝓯𝓸𝓷𝓽𝓼.
4. No nicknames designed to annoy, insult, or impersonate other users.
5. Do not change your nickname to hoist yourself to the top of the member list.
## Infractions
We generally follow a two-strike policy for our rules. If you notice someone breaking them, please mention or DM a staff member and we’ll deal with it as soon as we can.

Possible actions we take include:

- A public verbal warning
- A formal bot warning
- A short temporary mute
- A long temporary mute
- A kick from the server
- A temporary ban from the server
- A permanent ban from the server

While serious infractions are discussed internally before a punishment is given, simpler infractions are dealt with by individual staff members and the punishment they hand out is left to their own discretion.
